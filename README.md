# The Scoop

Work in progress :)


Steps to add a source if source is already in DB
- add an Object to `src/config/sources.js` with:
- Name -> name of the source (Must match name of source collection in DB)
- Link -> link to page that articles were scraped from
- Theme -> add a theme to `src/assets/styles/sourceThemes/`
- Logo -> add a logo to `src/assets/images/sourceLogos/`
